# 3-3. Your Own List: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

favs = ["F-22", "Stojadin", "MK-Ultra", "Civivi"]
print("When I go to work next time it would be so nice of US Army could lend me one " + favs[0] + " so I can get there faster and in style..." )
print("I had to sell my " + favs[1] + " cos it was burning more oil than petrol :)")
print("I own 2 magnificent things from " + favs[3] + ": Tactical pen and a folding knife.")
print("Sometimes I wish I was a guinipig for US Army's experiment " + favs[2])
